the show really we're get to kick things

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
off with a couple of recipes U using

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,119
these amazing leaks which we're going to

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,159
celebrate from A supplier in

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
Lincolnshire that I'm going to introduce

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,400
you to in a bit but I'm going to do

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,520
these two recipes at Ace one of which is

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,759
my favorite the other one is I I found

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,560
on my little spot of Spanish Adventure

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,920
little tap pass sort of dish but the

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,479
first thing we do is take our bacon so

36
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,520
this is for the so the tapy sort of one

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,360
so we take the the bacon like that I'm

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,079
going to basically into little

39
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,320
lons and then all I'm going to do is fry

40
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,880
this off cuz the important thing is with

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
this we actually use the Bacon Fat to

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
make the dressing as well so you use a

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,280
little bit of vegetable oil and we're

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,159
going to fry off this little bit of

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,880
bacon so you get it nice and crisp in

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
here I'm going to take the other part of

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
the leaks and we're going to do leaks

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,320
baked in Brios with which I absolutely

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,240
adore it's one of my favorite things

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,399
with cheese on the top it tastes but

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,200
we're going to cut these

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,199
leaks and chop them all up and they're

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,239
just going to go in the pan with some

54
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,720
fresh Brios I've got over here Touch of

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,840
cream some white wine some fresh thyme

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
and these gets toasted and roasted and

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
everything else and these are going to

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
go in the oven with a little little bit

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,840
of cheese as well over the top so while

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,400
these are cooking and while my Bacon's

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,280
cooking why don't we head off to a farm

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120

the field as well to show us where this

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
produce come from so first of all how

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,560
did it all start cuz you're you're what

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
fourth

73
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,080
generation uh yeah it's well there

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,319
there's four generations on on the farm

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,519
although um the youngest aren aren't uh

76
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:01,959
fully employed they're still at school

77
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,400
but they do plenty of school holiday

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,840
stuff you got the word you forgot the

79
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,799
word yet there was uh my granddad uh

80
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,879
started off when he was in the RAF based

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,159
here on lancasters in the second world

82
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,159
war a rear Gunner met Manan they set up

83
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,080
here so they got a little bit of land

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,519
and uh expanded a little bit and then my

85
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,599
dad came into the farm um and in the 70s

86
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,400
they bought their own farm that they

87
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
could actually Farm outright on and and

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,080
uh they grew it from there and in the

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
'90s

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
1991 they started growing leaks and uh

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,319
we're still growing them now so I'm

92
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,720
going to take the onions that's going to

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
go in the pan with the bacon we're just

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,519
going to soften the onion so you don't

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
you fry up the bacon till it's crispy

96
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,599
and soping the onions in here but like I

97
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,799
said the fat is the key part of this to

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
make the dressing so I've got the leaks

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,400
cooking away nicely over here with some

100
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,720
fresh thyme and in there we're going to

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,120
have some white wine Brios and put the

102
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,360
cheese on the top keep it really nice

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,159
and Light but this is what we do with

104
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,840
this we pass it through a c so we get

105
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,879
this amazing oil from it as

106
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,519
well that goes in there so tell me about

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,360
leak production then because I didn't

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
realize how labor intensive it is yeah I

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,160
think you can see behind me we' got some

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,238
guys working really hard and the

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,639
conditions today are awful uh with the

112
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,520
amount of rain that we've had um so yeah

113
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,160
it it's it's really hard hard graft it

114
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
really is you got to pull them by hand

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,639
then trim them up and then we put them

116
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,680
through a wash and bring them back chill

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
them and then give them a little trim

118
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,600
and then pack them

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,199
out and your fa your father's still

120
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,479
doing this and he your your parents are

121
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,120
still involved in the farm still working

122
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,039
on the

123
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,600
farm yeah yeah my dad is specially is

124
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,080
very active and he's 73 now in fact 74 I

125
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,759
think um yeah he he he works as hard as

126
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,199
anyone um yeah and I didn't realize as

127
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,720
well when I was doing a little bit of

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,360
research before I was talking to you

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,440
that that leaks you the predominantly uh

130
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,080
some of which you produce on site and

131
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,800
you grow them for seedlings but a lot of

132
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,160
them you bring in from uh Morocco and

133
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Spain and in warmer climates and bring

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
them in and plant them as sort of little

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
shoots well yeah it's it's it's the

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,759
early production so to try and get the

137
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,400
uh early start to the season in the

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
summer when we start harvesting in July

139
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,479
we'll bring plants from Morocco or Spain

140
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,720
that have been uh propagated quite early

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,840
on in well climates that are far more

142
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,280
suitable they get brought open we plant

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
them out in the field and and they're

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,960
ready earlier than what we can do at

145
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,080
just solely from UK glass houses or from

146
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,120
seed but then we'll go right through

147
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,960
till uh the end of April beginning of

148
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,120
May um harvesting and we can store and

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,199
for a few weeks and keep keep supplying

150
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,880
British Leakes into May and June what

151
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,840
about you as a king Gardener are you

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
deviled into the Garden or not my wife's

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,800
grandfather is a very keen Gardener with

154
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,240
he's got poly tunnels he's he's in his

155
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,880
70s and he's right into it and it's just

156
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,039
it's a lot of hard work and passion that

157
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,240
goes into growing stuff isn't it well

158
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,880
well leaks particularly because I've had

159
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,319
I've had good success with leaks some

160
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,479
years and then other years nothing what

161
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,319
what what what do you need I mean

162
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,080
obviously where you live this the soil

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,759
what what is this special about where

164
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,840
you are in the production of leaks well

165
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,240
it it's h the soil is really important

166
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,000
we've got nice sandy soil here which

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,960
makes it easier for getting on in the

168
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,680
spring and then also easier getting them

169
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,440
off in the winter but it's uh yeah you

170
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,800
also it doesn't want to be uh too wet uh

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,759
because leaks don't like wet feet but at

172
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,160
the same time they still need a lot of

173
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,440
uh irrigation or rain to grow a little

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
of water so you got to have good

175
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,639
irrigation as well but look hopefully

176
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm doing this Justice over here Sim you

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,599
can see this this is this this is a

178
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,000
perfect dish when you come back from the

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,599
field really but this is leaks this is

180
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,960
Brios it's cheese Got Cream I've got

181
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,199
some white wine in here and I'm going to

182
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,919
do is pop it in here to Brown the other

183
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,039
leaks are we're going to do with this

184
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,560
dressing so I've toasted the hazelnuts

185
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,280
this is the the uh onions with that but

186
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,120
the leaks I'm got in here all we do with

187
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,479
these leaks is you just take the entire

188
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,919
lot and put it straight on the coals I

189
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,319
don't know where you ever cooked leaks

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,840
like this but you just put them straight

191
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,879
on the barbecue on the coals and you

192
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,919
blacken the skin and when you blacken

193
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,440
the skin and you take take them off it

194
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,240
ends up like this because leaks like you

195
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,560
said you mentioned moisture and water

196
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,280
they contain tons of water and you can

197
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,800
utilize that to create the steam to cook

198
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,479
the

199
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,720
leaks so these just got I don't know

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,199
whether you've had this Tim cooked on

201
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,360
the barbecue just simple like

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,800
this no I I've actually have not tried

203
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,120
them like that but that just goes to

204
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,199
show how versatile they are well that's

205
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,560
the thing you just put them straight on

206
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,120
the coals and then when we slice them

207
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,720
all up they Steam

208
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,000
I can see he's thinking what recipe can

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,680
I put that with with with with that one

210
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,560
when I put it on the menu but the

211
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,319
dressing for this is the key to it when

212
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,000
you just take the leaks like this I had

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,319
this in a lovely little tapas bar in

214
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,120
Spain and uh it wasn't with the leaks it

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
was just this dressing with pork but the

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,319
dressing sort of appealed to me that I

217
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,000
thought it would be really good with

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
this you just take the leaks like that

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
don't mind about the little Char bits as

220
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,159
well you want those and then the

221
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,759
dressing bit over here so you take take

222
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,479
the bacon and the onions like that and

223
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,919
then the dressing bit is the key so keep

224
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,000
my eye on what's Happening behind me but

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,479
the dressing uses the fat from the

226
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,000
bacon

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,080
some dejon mustard bit of that cherry

228
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,600
vinegar over the top as

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
well touch's Hazen nut

230
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
oil we've got the hazelnuts going

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,040
through it as well this is the key to it

232
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
I was wondering what this was in Spain

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
and I went around the back of the

234
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,880
kitchen Spanish is not very good anyway

235
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,800
let alone oyster sauce in Spanish but

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
this this is what they used and these

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,399
oyster sauce you mix that looks like

238
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,640
quite a thick oyster sauce that James it

239
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,279
is but it MiFi into this creamy

240
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,320
dressing and then you put lemon zest in

241
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,480
it lemon zest a bit of lemon juice that

242
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,480
sits on there but just squeeze a lemon

243
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,640
juice some fresh herbs and that's your

244
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,720
dressing done add a little bit of pass

245
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
it to it and that's it and you mentioned

246
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,279
the fact that's so versatile as well I

247
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,360
mean I I take it do you have do you have

248
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,440
an early crop Tim or do you have a later

249
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,399
crop or is it they all just happen all

250
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,800
at once and that's where the workload

251
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
is no no well uh we we go for 11 months

252
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,440
of the year harvesting leaks start in

253
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,600
July and finish the following May time

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,399
sometimes well I wish you all the very

255
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,680
bested up with it I know you want to get

256
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,760
back to work and I'm just going to

257
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,519
finish this off I've done it justice as

258
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,519
well but thank you for joining us good

259
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
luck with everything and thank you on

260
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,160
behalf of the entire country for doing

261
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,200
what you're doing because it is hard

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,399
work very thank you very much thank you

263
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,480
very much good luck thank you very much

264
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,399
but look you just got the little

265
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,120
dressing over the top that's your this

266
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,399
is the oyster sauce the fat from the

267
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,600
bacon over the top and it creates this

268
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,880
wonderful little salad and there we have

269
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,120
it leaks two ways one cooked with cream

270
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,959
and Brios and cheese and that kind of

271
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,680
stuff cooked really really simple the

272
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,640
other one straight on the cuse and this

273
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
is how you cook it it just as it is as

274
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,600
the leaks go black on one side you turn

275
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,079
them over cook them on the other side

276
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,800
and all the steam all the the moisture

277
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,240
that's in the leaks will steam the

278
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,360
inside of it and cook the middle and you

279
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,720
just get rid of the outside easy as that

280
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
amazing

281
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,959
you got your eye on that one haven't you

282
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,680
really the barbecued leaks buzz in for

283
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,639
this they're uh and then these the the

284
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,000
the cheesy creamy leaks look really

285
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,519
simple keto is don't overcook the leaks

286
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,800
because you want the flavor from it

287
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,480
that's the when you have great produce

288
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,920
like this don't overcook it whether it's

289
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,839
in a soup only takes like8 minutes to

290
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,240
make a soup 10

291
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,880
minutes that's so simple but it's so

292
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,399
complex when you eat it like clever SMY

293
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,440
note I had it in a tapas bar and I

294
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,639
couldn't for the life of me think what

295
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,680
flavor it was from it and it's that bit

296
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,079
of oyster sauce that was with it and

297
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,800
it's delicious it's really nice isn't it

298
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
really unusual they have a little bit of

299
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,000
the creamy leaks as well to go with it

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,320
but that's with a Brios as

301
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,160

it's ready I think ready St it was 32

327
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,760
years something like that but I have

328
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
thought it you know see my memory it's

329
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,199
not it's over 30 years what are you

going to be cooking then a pear crumble

331
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,360
this is a dish that I literally used to

332
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,839
do in Ros gos and of course it's pair

333
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,240
time of the year these are commas pairs

334
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,800
um so what I do is I take a little knife

338
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,839
we're going we're going to cut them up a

339
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
wee bit roast them I think uh I mean you

340
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,199
could just put them directly in the oven

341
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,920
but I like to get a little bit of the

342
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,000
juices going get lemon juice in there

343
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,199

equal

373
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,320
weights it's because you give us wine

that's no good anyway cuz we we have to

422
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,360
shut down cuz we're losing money and

423
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,040
then we devised a plan to to uh to take

424
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
advantage of the Michelin store yeah

425
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
yeah so what do you put you put almonds

426
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,959
in the bottom I put some ground almonds

427
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,560
in the bottom to soak up a little bit of

428
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,680
of the the liquid that come come out of

429
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,920
the pears you know that's kind of an old

430
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,759
French past project trip you know I've

431
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,240
never seen some sugar in here I'll put

432
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,880
it in there Chief you've got sugar in

433
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,560
there Su in yeah any lemon juice in

434
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,519
there just just sugar at the

435
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,920
yeah with pear no with with with fruit

436
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,480
in general you know we tend to think

437
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,720
that you know fruit is fruit a and that

438
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,640
we don't need to be too careful with it

439
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,599
but but fruit is an ingredient so we

440
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,720
need to be playing with things like the

441
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,160
acidity and the sweetness and the

442
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,400
ripness quite a lot if you're going to

443
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,959
be a good pastry chef you should treat

444
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,720
it the same way as we treat sauces so

445
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,520
you're seasoning the pears with lemon

446
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,960
juice yes because pears tend to be

447
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,640
really quite sweet you know um I once

448
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,760
had a PE

449
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,000
Tartan in in Marco's restaurant he sent

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,520
it out complimentary and actually it was

451
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,080
it was wasn't great because there wasn't

452
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,240
enough acid in it was all too sweet yeah

453
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,960
um pears need a bit of acidity which is

454
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,280
why the raspberries are nice and the

455
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,880
lemon juice is nice so you got lemon

456
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
juice in there I'm going to take the SI

457
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,720
because I'm going to pass the the yeah

458
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,440
please the rasp is in there as well so

459
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,039
your Pairs and you use this as a little

460
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
bit should I whisk the bowl or

461
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,480

462
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,159

465
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,679
like nothing I'm sitting back in a of

466
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,919
you remember we used we used to cook

467
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,280
things like crumbles and sponges and

468
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,039
tartans quite a lot on steady cook

469
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,799
because only had 20 minutes we could get

470
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,840
it done quickly you know it's like it

471
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,400
wasn't if you made a pastry you had to

472
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,520
bring it all together and then roll it

473
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,440
out

474
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,520
and then get it on neatly Etc was you

475
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,679
did a crumble

476
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,200
it that on what people didn't realize

477
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,080
you do you do that I mean I used to go

478
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,640
back to the restaurant You' You' you'd

479
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,799
finish filming at sort of 5 or six o' do

480
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,280
service and then you'd be back in for

481
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
service that night you would be you'd be

482
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,120
you be backed in service un often CU we

483
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
had the hotel we go I'd do breakfast in

484
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,840
the

485
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,320
morning then go up to filming film two

486
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,360
shoot two shows and then you you'd go

487
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,240
back into the restaurant again but

488
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,000
phenomenal cuz these these guys used to

489
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,760
go out clubing that's I I never went to

490
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,679
a clubbing in my life master and servant

491
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,120

492
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
more they come eat your restaurant you'd

493
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,159
have to cook for him

494
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,640
that's okay um I think in the recipe

495
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,200
that I sent you you said you can put in

496
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,840
a bit of flour but nowadays I tend to

497
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,240
use the sort of Yankee thing where you

498
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
put in a bit of corn flour just to hold

499
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,000
the juices together because there's

500
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,440
quite a lot of juices in this now here

501
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
you want lemon in the cream little bit

502
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,440
of sugar and you you put the raspberry

503
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,120
through I don't put the the lemon in yet

504
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,480
whip the cream first please the lemon

505
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,640
goes in the wee bit near the

506
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080

516
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,400
offering with my brother at a local

517
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,159
Bowling Club it's called the Belmont

518
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,200
bowling club right and it's like it's

519
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,440
like Bast Wimbledon and we're going to

my brother wants to take a look at a

523
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,720
certain concept so I'm going to help him

524
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,320
with that um is your brother from a

525
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,440
Hospitality background no he's not which

528
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,240
age

529
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
now you see how that's come together

530
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,760
almost like a cookie bough yeah yeah

531
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,440
well I kind of crush it like that and

532
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,799
then I just break it up because I don't

533
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,640
like those sort of Sandy type crumbles I

534
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,000
like a crumble where it's almost bisc

535
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,559
and it's the butter that does that is on

536
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,880
top well it's sort of yeah it's

537
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,480
definitely the butter and the sugar

538
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,440
plays a huge part as well but it it's

539
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,679

comedy because comedy's changed so so

751
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,399
much you you you speak to many comedians

752
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,640
they do the whole circuit you do the

753
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,919
working Men's Clubs you do the whole

754
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,600
thing yours was a different avenue but

755
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,919
also yours was a totally different look

756
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,200
at comedy you you characters was your

757
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,559
big thing nobody had really done it I

758
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,679
supp I don't know I there was you know

759
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,919
there was loads of character actors um

760
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,559
before I didn't invent doing characters

761
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,080
cuz of course Sasha Baron Co was Ali G

762
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,880
before um I I came on the scene but but

763
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,720
you were taking those characters and and

764
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,399
and they were sort of taking over your

765
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,840
life you know Keith Lemon people

766
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,360
genuinely must think you're Keith Lemon

767
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,159
well they do I'm forever saying now all

768
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,919
my name's leak when people go Keith can

769
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,919
I have a picture and I say oh my name's

770
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:17,000
Lee and do a picture and then they don't

771
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,240
believe my name's Lee or they laugh and

772
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,320
I go it's not funny Lee is not a funny

773
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,600

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,880
um but yeah they don't people don't

777
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,360
believe they don't understand that Keith

778
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,919
Lemon um was just a character as was

779
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,200
Avid Maran but I I live to those

780
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,519
characters and I thought it's easier

781
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,080
just to be them rather than tell you

782
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,760
about them was was that a a release side

783
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,399

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,000
of flooded with celebrities doing kids

870
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,080

871
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,399
we're interested in doing a memoir why

872
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,840
do you want to do it I said well cuz I'm

873
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,240
50 and I feel like that chapter of my

874
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,559
life what everyone knows me of that's

875
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,200
the end of that chapter and now I'm

876
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,639
going into a new chapter even though I

877
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,760
don't know what's going to

878
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,240
happen is that difficult for you cuz you

879
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,840
you spent your entire life in characters

880
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,320
and bit pieces or do you look at it and

881
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,599
go that's character it's not really

882
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,040
relevant anymore I don't want to do that

883
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,918
anymore you just that's that's that's a

884
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,199
moment in time and then I'm looking I

885
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,560
feel like it's a moment in time if was

886
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,159
on this and I feel like um it was quite

887
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,879
fashionable to to do characters and and

888
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,440
I don't know if it's that fashionable

889
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,000
cuz now it's the real you you know

890
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,560
you're Ching to this is is this the real

891
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,199
you yeah yeah I'm not I guess I'm not as

892
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,760
rude as Keith Lemon or as silly as Keith

893
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,599
Lemon but a lot of people think oh are

894
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,199
you shy in real life but I'm not I'm not

895
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,159
shy at all definitely definitely not shy

896
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,280
wasn't in the restaurant when I knew

897
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,480

898
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,040
be shy and do those sort of things I

899
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,679
guess although they do say a lot of

900
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,599
actors are quite quiet in real life I

901
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,960
guess they don't want to show off and go

902
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,119
look how great I am but anyway look we

903
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,918

region of Castilla lancha home to the

1043
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,319

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,000
Spain's most famous cheese originates

1052
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,400
and comes from these parts and that's

1053
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,440
Mano like French champagne Mana has a

1054
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
protected designation of origin meaning

1055
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,839
it has to be made in L

1056
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,640
mancha I'm visiting La Pruden Siana Farm

00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,960
farm is less than 20 km away they can

1076
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,280
make the cheese here with raw milk so

1077
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,480
there's no need to pasteurize it it's

1078
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,440
pumped into Vats where it's heated and

1079
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,200
in 1 hour 45 minutes that milk start

1080
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,680
getting solid then it's passed through a

1081
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,640
big mixing machine until the curds and

1082
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,440
whe are ready to be

1083
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,920
separated so you take the cheese the

1084
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,359
liquid the liquid goes and we put it on

1085
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,760
the trees because they way have a lot of

1086
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
protein well it's very good for the

1087
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,400
trees cuz they look fantastic outside

1088
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,119
yeah it's very good next the cheese is

1089
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,400
poured into a mold transferred into a

1090
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,599
salt bath and left to set for 24

1091
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,720
hours the 600 cheese in there 600 of

1092
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,160
those in one

1093
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,880
batch you're probably wondering what's

1094
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,400
like some Roman bath but over here the

1095
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,319
reason for this is it presses it cheese

1096
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,520
down otherwise would just

1097
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,760
float

1098
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,920
wow look at that this is great to see it

1099
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,520
like this because when you feel it it's

1100
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,839
kind of like a it's like a soft bre it's

1101
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,480
a it's a fresh cheese yeah

1102
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,960
wow once the cheese is set the wheels

1103
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,319
are transferred into aging rooms where

1104
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:17,040
they're left to

1105
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,119
mature this is the bit I've been looking

1106
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,480
forward

1107
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,040
to just check this

1108
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,480
out there are literally thousands

1109
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,319
thousands how many you have in here we

1110
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,359
don't know you don't know just thousands

1111
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,319
of them so what's the difference between

1112
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:37,680
a semic cure cheese and a cure cheese

1113
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,079
The semic Cure cheese spend the 3 four

1114
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,839
month and when if have more months this

1115
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:43,960
The

1116
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,839
Cure the longer the cheese matures the

1117
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:48,920
stronger the flavor and Santiago wants

1118
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,520
me to try

1119
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,040
some okay now we taste I'm looking

1120
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,359
forward to

1121
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:58,359
this this is a mild Mana a from 3 to 4

1122
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:00,440
months it's quite interesting while he's

1123
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,240
chopping that up is that I can see the

1124
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,559
oldfashioned Press particularly the

1125
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,359
wooden boards that the cheese would sit

1126
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:07,920
on but

1127
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,000
also the little band that you sort of

1128
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,240
wrap it with to get that familiar sort

1129
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,400
of pattern with it as well right so this

1130
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,119
is the semic cured semic

1131
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,599
cured it's beautiful I do love Mano I

1132
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,359
really do whether you have it with just

1133
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,720
hamon which is just beautiful

1134
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,160
next is a mano the mature in extra

1135
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,279
virgin olive oil for 10 to 12

1136
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,520
months that's special huh you can taste

1137
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,280
the olive you describe you can taste the

1138
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,119
olive oil but it's much more rounded

1139
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,440
it's like fine wine the old it gets in

1140
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,800
the bottle the the the barrel the better

1141
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,559
it gets

1142
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,000
but this is the same

1143
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,040
yeah you almost don't want to cook with

1144
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,760
this you just want to just eat it as it

1145
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,520
is you know you don't do anything with

1146
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,040
it you know this you can play around

1147
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,480
with it but this is just this is too

1148
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,079
good you just eat it as it is and it's

1149
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,240
wow this is

1150
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,559

food lover as well so I thought I

1177
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,440
thought with this i' thought you'd do a

1178
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,960
classic roast chicken nice roast chicken

1179
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,160
with a differ so we're going to cook it

1180
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,559
with hay right so hay you you this is

1181
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,240
Pet Shop hay don't get it from the the

1182
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,720
rabbit hutch otherwise those little bits

1183
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
of raisins tanas are not very good in

1184
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,599
here but you just got look you just got

1185
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:34,760
your standard Pet Shop hay and then I've

1186
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,559
got some chicken and all you really do

1187
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:37,839
with that is

1188
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,480
just that what I'm going to do is use

1189
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,720
some of this this is a bit of lavender

1190
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,680
and use the cooking lavender really so

1191
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,800
when you're going around the garden

1192
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,040
center there's lavender used for soap

1193
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,960
and medicinal stuff and then you get the

1194
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,000
cooking one there's loads of different

1195
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,240
varieties but that's that one that I'm

1196
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,040
going to pop in here so I can't just go

1197
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,760
in my garden and pick my lavender I

1198
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,240
don't know what lavender you've got but

1199
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,599
that's because there's going to be sort

1200
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:00,720
of How It's grown and all yes I just

1201
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,440
take it take just use a little bit of it

1202
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,160
if it tastes of soap then don't use it

1203
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,520
again right so is the flavor different

1204
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,440
then yeah lav all the lavender is

1205
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,559
different you get tons of different sort

1206
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:12,200
of flavored lavenders some more fragrant

1207
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,400
the other so if you were going to if you

1208
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,960
wanted to grow lavender for for culinary

1209
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,359
purp cooking lavend you get the cooking

1210
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:19,960
ones that you're I seen it at the Garden

1211
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,800
Center the other day by the by the herb

1287
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,160
double of my wife when I met her and to

1288
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,839
cut a really long story short his wife

1289
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,559
turned out to be my birth mother I have

1290
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:13,760
two half sisters also in the business

1291
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,359
the whole family were in the business

1292
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,599
Kate my sister is Wendy and Bob the

1293
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,119
Builder and Sean the Sheep and animation

1294
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,520
she spent their life you know sounding

1295
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,720
like various animals and creatures uh in

1296
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,280
animation so yeah that that it was it

1297
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,200
was in the blood and you say about this

1298
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,960
because you WR you you've written a book

1299
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,400
you say it's not an autobiography but

1300
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,240
you look at your your life as well

1301
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,160
as comparing with the other people's

1302
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,119
lives as well it's no so what it is i'

1303
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,240
I've written a book um it's called a

1304
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,480
work in progress it's it's it's for

1305
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,920
women of a certain age you know I'm 61

1306
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,599
now and you know I think a lot of women

1307
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,799
once they the kids have grown up and we

1308
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:55,200
get to that point of our life where

1309
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,839
society would like to see a Shuffle off

1310
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,440
and it's like we feel you can feel like

1311
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,559
we're not that we're past our Prime that

1312
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,280
we don't have a voice that we're not

1313
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,720
relevant we filled with self-doubt and

1314
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,319
this is a book to empower women of that

1315
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,480
age so it's a it's a call to arms for

1316
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,799
women of a certain age and I use the

1317
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:15,640
first half of the book by telling my

1318
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,200
stories and my backgrounds and I use my

1319
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,960
stories to then in the second half of

1320
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,400
the book show how to affect change in

1321
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,000
your life in my own life and how you

1322
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,400
hopefully can affect that change to live

1323
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,160
fearlessly in your in your your older

1324
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,720
years that's you on screen for for 20 20

1325
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,160
odd years 25 years 25 years you don't

1326
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,880
come across as you come across as very

1327
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,720
confident but I get the feeling your

1328
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,040
private life is your private life you

1329
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,640
like to keep that separate that's I

1330
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,280
think do you think I think that's always

1331
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,760
the key to to doing this for longevity I

1332
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,079
I do the same thing I think you've got

1333
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,000
to have it's difficult to separate the

1334
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,319
two but I think there's got to be two

1335
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,720
don't you I mean I'm I'm stage now where

1336
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,559
I I kind of I finally like myself and I

1337
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,480
am confident in who I am and I don't

1338
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,440
answer to anybody but for many many many

1339
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,720
years I I found it excruciating I would

1340
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,400
have this bront that everyone would see

1341
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,079
nobody would know but inside I was

1342
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,640
incredibly anxious full of self-doubt

1343
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,720
and Loathing so this this was the time

1344
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,280
that I wanted to share what helped what

1345
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,480
changed how I feel that I've changed in

1346
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,000
my life what's helped me and and in the

1347
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,640
hope that it will will help other women

1348
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,559
because you know no matter what we do

1349
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,000
the circumstances we have you know the

1350
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,680
roles the jobs we have pretty much all

1351
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,920
of us as human beings are suffering with

1352
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,720
the same problems in our inner world you

1353
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,920
know those moments of you know

1354
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,280
insecurity and not being good enough and

1355
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,440
being I'm thinking of this with this

1356
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,799
Source am I getting this right but this

1357
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,880
is this is in here so we've got the shot

1358
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,559
I won't judge you for it no this is the

1359
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:54,920
shots and the garlic that gone in here

1360
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,960
I've Cris up my little bit of over here

1361
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,160
I've got my mushrooms over here the the

1362
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,880
the chicken quite simply just gets

1363
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,400
roasted like you would do with a normal

1364
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,799
chicken like this and then we just take

1365
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:07,880
it out would you only use wild mushrooms

1366
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,839
for this no you can use any mushrooms to

1367
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,280
be honest so it's wild mushrooms are

1368
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,520
great cuz this time of the year um and

1369
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,400
we want to showcase that really as chefs

1370
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,280
we just like to say these are amazing

1371
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,680
look out for them they are around all

1372
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,400
over this country as well these depends

1373
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,040
on where you live of course but and can

1374
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,680
I check something because you've used

1375
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,799
just hay from the pet shop yeah so the

1376
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:31,760
juices that would have come out of that

1377
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,160
I know the hay will absorb it but you

1378
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,480
couldn't then use some of the pan juices

1379
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,960
no you you'd have to put it on a trivet

1380
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,520
if you want to do that but you don't

1381
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,880
really need it for this because the the

1382
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,599
key to this is all about the the sauce

1383
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,240
so then you can start deglazing it with

1384
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,599
a little bit of this is that

1385
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,559
the the noily whats it yes that's I've

1386
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,839
been to this marcian Haven they I've

1387
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,040
been to that and then you allow that to

1388
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,920
reduce a little bit and then you use

1389
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,480
this stock cuz if you put this stock in

1390
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,880
it makes a sauce instantly wow so

1391
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,760
usually with stock you've got to reduce

1392
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,880
it to get the flavor this one you can

1393
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,079
turn up the heat and almost get a sauce

1394
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,160
straight away with a touch of the

1395
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,119
mustard and some cream and that kind of

1396
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:11,520
stuff but I want to talk to you about

1397
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,160
what you've done away from sort of Cory

1398
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,200
Coronation Street as we or Cory as we

1399
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,760
call it in my house but CRA was another

1400
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,359
thing you you must to to get on stage

1401
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,559
that must have been a great release from

1402
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,240
you doing that really because when you

1403
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,200
did it you didn't actually watch sister

1404
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,319
before you were in it is that right no I

1405
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:31,799
well I I I haven't been on stage for 25

1406
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:33,920
years and then this year they came and

1407
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,040
said would you like to do the national

1408
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,200
tour of Sister Act and I thought well I

1409
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,440
can either just out of you know being

1410
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,839
scared and frightened and all those say

1411
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,880
no or I can just embrace it and I went

1412
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,960
yeah I'll do that you know I want to do

1413
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,920
going forward I'm just doing things that

1414
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,480
really interest me and I find fun I've

1415
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,720
done the I me my son's grown up I've

1416
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,920
been I've done all my all all my

1417
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,000
beautiful roles and I've enjoyed being a

1418
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,119
mother but I very much have chosen that

1419
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,359
this decade is for me and it yeah and it

1420
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:06,119
started with you know when I got asked

1421
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:08,480
to go in the jungle that the question I

1422
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,200
you know I immediately went no no no no

1423
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,160
no no and then I thought why am I saying

1424
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,040
no and the only reason I could think of

1425
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,680
was that I was scared and you know I've

1426
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,599
talk in the book about one of my biggest

1427
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,200
fears about going to the Jungle had

1428
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,400
phobia about snakes can't touch a

1429
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,799
couldn't touch a snake on the page and

1430
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:27,200
then I really thought about and thought

1431
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,160
how many times have I actually come face

1432
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,480
to face with the snake where it's

1433
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,240
wrapped itself around me it's taken a

1434
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,640
chunk out of me never in my life so I

1435
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,920
realized I just thought I was frightened

1436
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,039
the snakes and as I got there and I

1437
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,480
found out that you know I wouldn't share

1438
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,000
a room with the snake I wouldn't invite

1439
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,119
one over fatigue but you know I'm

1440
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:46,119
actually I don't have a phobia I just

1441
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:48,280
thought I did so and that's what I've

1442
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,839
that's how I've been living since then

1443
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,119
I'm just whatever comes up I'm not going

1444
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:55,280
to say no because I'm unsure or scared

1445
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,720
I'm just going to say yeah and see where

1446
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,400
it takes me well see where it goes well

1447
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,920
I'm just going to finish off recapping

1448
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,359
what we got over here there we have your

1449
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,039
lovely mashed potato this is the other

1450
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,440
part of the butter that you didn't see

1451
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,520
going this is the butter and the cream

1452
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,200
in this mashed potato over here how much

1453
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,480
how many potatoes are in there

1454
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,160
two what pack of butter two potatoes

1455
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,400
yeah pack of butter and and a and a bit

1456
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,480
of cream a lot of cream it's going to go

1457
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,880
in there and then the sauce gets reduced

1458
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,760
down but the key to this sauce is you

1459
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,160
use a tiny little bit whenever you got

1460
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,760
anything with bacon and mushrooms bacon

1461
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,480
acrosses the fat which is lovely because

1462
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,640
the sauce is going to go in the last

1463
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,079
minute so that that's bacon goes in here

1464
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:37,160
and the mushrooms go in what I like to

1465
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,760
do with either bacon or mushrooms

1466
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,359
anything like that you add a tiny bit of

1467
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,599
cherry vinegar at the end and it just

1468
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:44,920
lifts it all up but what we're going to

1469
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,599
do is take our mashed potato beautiful

1470
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,160
like that so with that that hay will

1471
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,960
that have flavored that at all hopefully

1472
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,839
you're about to find out but you got

1473
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,280
little bit bit of the oh you see and

1474
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,280
I've got the leg Yeah little bit of the

1475
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,599
thigh little bit of the chicken breast

1476
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,440
over here like that and we got the sauce

1477
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,559
the sauce will freeze really well and

1478
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,520
you take this lovely mushrooms and the

1479
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,760
bacon so pretty and the sauce over the

1480
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,720
top so automnal so there we have

1481
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,520

this week's masas and this week's mascas

1509
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,920
I thought I'd teach you how to cook and

1510
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,960
prepare a brilliant bit of place in one

1511
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,880
of my favorite dishes really this is

1512
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,400
really a chef's favorite dish gons and

1513
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,000
know they say it's really simple but it

1514
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,640
is really really simple it's Classic

1515
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,480
this particularly when You' got fish as

1516
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,960
good as this this has come from the West

1517
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,839
country it's come line CAU usually these

1518
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,599
these are all beautiful I've actually

1519
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,839
caught these myself not this size

1520
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,920
slightly smaller off sort of the needles

1521
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,880
area really on sandbanks like that but

1522
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,960
this time of the year they're absolutely

1523
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,319
superb and I wanted to show you this

1524
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,799
because I use these in the restaurant

1525
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,079
even yesterday I was cooking with it in

1526
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,559
the restaurant now how do you face it

1527
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,280
how do you prepare something like this

1528
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,440
well the first thing is is you remove

1529
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,559
what we call the fins or the skirt so

1530
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:27,680
this is the classic called the little

1531
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,720
skirt or the fin you just cut these with

1532
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,440
a pair of scissors all the way around

1533
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,319
here now the same process applies

1534
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:38,000
whatever flatfish you're preparing so

1535
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,880
you always really start off like this

1536
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,000
the classic bin dova Soul DOA sing yeah

1537
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,359
that that sort of fish that's cooked on

1538
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:48,160
the bone we remove these off prior to

1539
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,359
cooking it whole so just trim these off

1540
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:53,319
like this just makes it easier to fill

1541
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:55,440
it but what's quite interesting when you

1542
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,119
do stuff like like this you actually see

1543
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,799
it the fets how they actually sit how

1544
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:01,720
they actually are and then when you do

1545
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,440
order something on the bone which is the

1546
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,640
best way to do it if you are going to

1547
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,599
cook fish like this on the bone it's the

1548
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:07,799
best way to actually eat it in the

1549
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:09,520
restaurant you then know where the bones

1550
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,559
are so Nature's been amazing it's

1551
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:13,960
actually drawn a line all the way down

1552
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,520
here cuz there's four filets on a

1553
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,160
flatfish two on a round fish four either

1554
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,680
side so you got one there one there and

1555
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,160
then on the other side turn this over

1556
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,960
you got one there now ever so slightly

1557
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,079
you can see this line appear on the

1558
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:29,160
other side as well so this is where your

1559
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,119
knife Cuts one that side and one that

1560
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,599
side so it will turn that around and you

1561
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,079
follow the knife along that line now

1562
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,400
it's depends on which knife you want to

1563
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,200
use really this is classed as a sort of

1564
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,640
a A Classic fiting knife you can see the

1565
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,760
blade bends this is a boning knife this

1566
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,039
is used predominantly for meat but I

1567
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:49,119
still use this to fill it fish with you

1568
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,559
can use either or really but you follow

1569
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:55,559
this line so get it exactly on there and

1570
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:57,680
the KN will go all the way down till it

1571
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,240
won't go any further down to the bone so

1572
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,720
if I do this you'll make the

1573
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,960
noise you can hear it just hit that bone

1574
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,240
now then what you do is you make sure

1575
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,599
you do this in

1576
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:12,720
long I'll change the knife now I'm using

1577
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,160
the filet knife cuz the filet knife

1578
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,559
bends like this this is what you want to

1579
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:17,319
do is push it down and as you're fiting

1580
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:18,880
it like this and pushing it along it

1581
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,079
follows the edge of the bone but when we

1582
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,079
put the knife in you start with long

1583
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,960
cuts so the knife goes in you make these

1584
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,880
long incisions so rather than do it sort

1585
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,440
of small incisions when you put the

1586
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,319
knife in you make these long cuts you're

1587
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:37,760
pressing the knife all the way down to

1588
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,680
the

1589
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,319
fillet to the Bone right the way down

1590
01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:43,920
all the way down like that and then as

1591
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,839
we go this goes all the way down and you

1592
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:49,559
start trimming off this entire fillet

1593
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:52,160
like this now you'll always have either

1594
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,160
a long fillet which is that and you'll

1595
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,160
have a short fillet on this side and the

1596
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,640
same the other side like I said four

1597
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,839
fillets and the idea is to get as much

1598
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:02,880
meat on the fillet and none on the bone

1599
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,119
like that you see the Bone's nice and

1600
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:05,400
clean which is what you want and do

1601
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,200
repeat the process the other side so

1602
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,760
I'll just leave that to one side because

1603
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,000
I'm going to

1604
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,079
concentrate on this one and make these

1605
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,400
gons so to do this now we can then trim

1606
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,760
this little bit off

1607
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,119
here trim that off it's entirely up to

1608
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:22,000
you whether you leave this on or trim it

1609
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,079
off but we trim that off and then you're

1610
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,160
left with a beautiful bit of fish now I

1611
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,039
actually leave the skin on I think it's

1612
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,119
a northern thing I don't know some

1613
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:34,079
people like it some people don't I love

1614
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,640
the skin on fish it's up to you so I'm

1615
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,200
going to go how I used to love it when I

1616
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,160
was a kid and we're going to take our

1617
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,920
gons and thinly slice the fish so slice

1618
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,160
it all the way through you want to make

1619
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,279
sure that this is not too thick the

1620
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:51,359
whole idea of gons is they just cook

1621
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,119
quite quickly so slice it all through

1622
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:54,839
like

1623
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:57,480
that now it depends what you want to do

1624
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,160
with in terms of fish you can do this

1625
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,359
with Cod you can do it with hadock you

1626
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,480
can do it with place it's entirely up to

1627
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,640
you but this is just beautiful you get

1628
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,319
these long pieces like that and you can

1629
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,440
just repeat the process now when you get

1630
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,760
fish this good as well don't be

1631
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,520
frightened to buy it fresh prepare it

1632
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,960
and freeze it as well because it freezes

1633
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,960
nicely this so once you got the fish

1634
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,720
like this

1635
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,240
keep all the bones all the bits and

1636
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,720
pieces all this you keep all this

1637
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,839
because it makes the most wonderful

1638
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:32,839
stock put it in cold water a little bit

1639
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:34,440
of aromat and peppercorns a little bit

1640
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,640
of celery onions bring it to the boil

1641
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,960
you don't waste any of it cook it for

1642
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,599
about 20 minutes fish stock because

1643
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,039
otherwise it starts to go a little bit

1644
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,839
bitter and then what you can do is

1645
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,200
freeze that and then you can use it for

1646
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,559
wherever you want as well soup and bits

1647
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:48,039
of pieces it's delicious so to make our

1648
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:50,319
little gons we've got a combination over

1649
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,039
here just quickly wash my hands we've

1650
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,880
got a combination of flour egg and bread

1651
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,960
crumbs now this is called tapan that's

1652
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,839
what the meaning is it means you

1653
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:03,119
basically flour it first then in egg and

1654
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,359
then in bread crumb so what you need to

1655
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:06,760
do first of all is season the flour so

1656
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,640
salt and

1657
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,839
pepper this is the seasoning bit rather

1658
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:11,960
than season the

1659
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,279
fish and you can pop the

1660
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:18,440
fish straight into here like that then

1661
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,119
we get some

1662
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:23,520
egg a little bit of egg like

1663
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,720
that and then we want some beaten egg

1664
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,400
do that quick

1665
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,880
mix then we grab the fish roll it in the

1666
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,440
flour like that this is just plain flour

1667
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,400
then you pop it into the egg so just get

1668
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,839
rid of any excess

1669
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:48,960
flour off of here we go that tray can

1670
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,319
then

1671
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,079
go then you bring this one

1672
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:56,880
up with this one so so roll it around in

1673
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,480
the egg like that flour egg and bread

1674
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,160
crumbs it's just one of the classic

1675
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,960
combinations when you get place this

1676
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,440
good like I said all fish is seasonal

1677
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,880
but this time of year it's so good at

1678
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,319
the moment is the place we get

1679
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,960
in so that can then sit in the

1680
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,760
breadcrumbs now these are panco

1681
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,640
breadcrumbs which are basically dried

1682
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,079
and shaved they produce a much crispier

1683
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:25,000
crumb you can just use normal white

1684
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,520
sliced bread but the best advice really

1685
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,480
is I would probably dry out not toast it

1686
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,279
but just dry out a low oven so once

1687
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:35,839
you've got that we've got our lovely

1688
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,319
crumb on our

1689
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:39,640
fish like this you can just pop it back

1690
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,799
on

1691
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,400
here like I said this once you've done

1692
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,440
this you can then freeze it and if you

1693
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,599
are freezing it the best off to do it is

1694
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,760
freeze it on a tray first rather than a

1695
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,760
bag otherwise it all just goes to one

1696
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,279
lump and then when it's frozen transfer

1697
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:56,000
it into a bag rather than just freeze it

1698
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,440
into a bag so that's that one so quickly

1699
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,960
wash my hands

1700
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:03,720
again and then the fryer I've set quite

1701
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,960
hot because these aren't going to take

1702
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,119
very long at all so I'm just going to

1703
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:08,400
leave those to one second which what we

1704
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,000
are going to do now is concentrate on

1705
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,119
the little garnish for this and this is

1706
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,920
a simple little TARTA sauce now to make

1707
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,760
your own tart sauce is way better than

1708
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,200
it is buying it miles better than using

1709
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,119
B in mayonnaise as well this is so so

1710
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:24,760
easy I'm going to show you it now so the

1711
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,640
the gons are only going to take well 30

1712
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,319
seconds a minute maybe something like

1713
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:34,960
that so you take the eggs first of

1714
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,720
all like

1715
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,319
that egg yolks you can use whole eggs

1716
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:41,400
for mayonnaise but I just

1717
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,279
use little bit of egg yolks and then

1718
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:46,760
what we're going to do is add some

1719
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,559
mustard always de your mustard for this

1720
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,240
never English mustard it's a bit strong

1721
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,799
that goes in there and then fire this up

1722
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:55,720
first of all get that going while

1723
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,599
happening we're just going to check on

1724
01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:00,319
our fryer turn it up a little bit pretty

1725
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,440
good and what you want to do is emulsify

1726
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,039
this together now you can add a touch of

1727
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:05,880
vinegar to start off with but what I'm

1728
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,359
going to do is just add that towards the

1729
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,680
end because you add the oil gently and

1730
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,599
it starts to mulfy this together this is

1731
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,319
just vegetable oil so you don't add

1732
01:07:15,319 --> 01:07:17,160
things like rape seed oil in mayonnaise

1733
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,559
no olive oil it's just vegetable oil now

1734
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,039
if you want to change the recipe a

1735
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,520
little bit and you like your salad cream

1736
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,799
cream you actually make your own solid

1737
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:30,680
cream it's done exactly the same way but

1738
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,960
you use hardboiled egg yolks so you put

1739
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,440
hardboiled egg yolks in here instead of

1740
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,279
raw egg yolks mustard touch your vinegar

1741
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:38,799
pour in the oil and you just finish that

1742
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:39,920
with a little bit of lemon juice touch

1743
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,559
your cream you've made your own solid

1744
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,000
cream but gradually gradually we're

1745
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,039
going to pour this in the Temptation is

1746
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,440
to add this quicker if you add it

1747
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,160
quicker sometimes the May a can split

1748
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,200
and then you almost OS start again and

1749
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,960
add the split liquid to a c more egg

1750
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,000
yolk so just take your

1751
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,160
time like that and it starts to thicken

1752
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,880
people think you more add more oil it

1753
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,400
gets thinner does the opposite and then

1754
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,680
to bring that back to make it thinner

1755
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,200
again now we add the touch of

1756
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,559
vinegar just a little bit of

1757
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:15,000
vinegar mix

1758
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:19,520
together you've now got the your

1759
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,238
own little mayonnaise we can then use

1760
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:26,158
this base I've done so much times before

1761
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,759
on the show as well in terms of adding

1762
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:30,520
things like ketchup and you've got your

1763
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,359
Merry rose sauce with a little bit of

1764
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,198
Brandy that we're going to make a

1765
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,319
classic Tata sauce now so for that we

1766
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:43,080
want Capers girkins and shalot so this

1767
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,399
is almost ready now so while I'm

1768
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:48,238
preparing this these can go in so take

1769
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,000
your simple little

1770
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,040
gons like

1771
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,399
this in the fryer

1772
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,880
nice hot fryer bang straight

1773
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,238
in going to want no more than about a

1774
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,920
minute minute and a half meanwhile we

1775
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,640
can pair a little

1776
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,120
shalot so when you're adding shalots to

1777
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,719
this and use shalots not onions they're

1778
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,238
too strong so you add this chop shalot

1779
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:14,960
get it nice and

1780
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,920
thin a nice and small dice for this as

1781
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,520
well so little bit of

1782
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:27,359
shalot then you've got some girkin

1783
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,759
going to go in there as well little bit

1784
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:32,880
of

1785
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,319
Capers all in and then you can take the

1786
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,198
whole

1787
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:40,880
lot straight into our

1788
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,158
bowl with some herbs I've got some

1789
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:45,560
parsley and a bit of Dill is the usual

1790
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,679
ones in a nice little bit of Tata

1791
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:51,238
sauce this is not far off now they don't

1792
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:53,359
take very long at

1793
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,840
all if you're cooking more than this do

1794
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,080
them in batches of

1795
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,400
course stops them oil sticking together

1796
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,159
but make sure the oil is really really

1797
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,440
hot CU you want the bread coms to Brown

1798
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,640
and you want the fish to cook quite

1799
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,120
quickly because the fish is nice and

1800
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,199
thin they'll cook quite quickly so

1801
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,800
pretty good they can come

1802
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,280
out out of there look at

1803
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,800
that touch your salt over the

1804
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,040
top sits to one side and we're going to

1805
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,840
finish this off now with uh

1806
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,679
few bits of herbs it's purely optional

1807
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,199
really Dill is the most prioritized one

1808
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:32,280
really what you want to put in here so

1809
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,280
dill and parsley I like to use for this

1810
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,280
but stay clear sort of coriander and

1811
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,600
that kind of stuff it's just

1812
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,480
overpowering but they're The Usual

1813
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,480
Suspects in a tart

1814
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,000
sauce Touch of

1815
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,880
that and then a little

1816
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,920
squeeze of lemon

1817
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,360
juice bit of on there as well and not

1818
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,640
forgetting the salt and the

1819
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,080
pepper and we're

1820
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,400
there and it just showcases this amazing

1821
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,719
fish to its best I think it really is

1822
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:11,719
delicious but look at that simple little

1823
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:15,199
T sauce bring this

1824
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,000
over you got this look at

1825
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,239
that so delicious so simple to make

1826
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,239
yourself and you got these

1827
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,080
gorgeous

1828
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,080
fresh gons a place they really are

1829
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,520
special when fish is this good as well

1830
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,760
and you don't forget you can use the

1831
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,440
entire look at that white that is in the

1832
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,120
middle don't forget you can use the

1833
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,159
entire lot of this fish as well you use

1834
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:46,080
the bones the skin everything so nothing

1835
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,120
gets

1836
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,080
wasted and

1837
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,120
then finally a little wedge

1838
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,960
of lemon

1839
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,920
to go with it just a little

1840
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,440

01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:02,080
this with some um tomato

1953
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,920
puree some wer sauce for a really Savory

1954
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,440
night and C that have you ever had an

1955
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,000
Italian taste this love all l no I can't

1956
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,960
say I have on might have had some

1957
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,719
stealth Italian customers of eating it

1958
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:17,719
but and again it's it's just our

1959
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:19,600
interpretation of like a more of a

1960
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,440
refined version of using the game yeah

1961
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,199
and then we're going to use red white

1962
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,440
wine in this as well your your

1963
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,120
restaurant itself so the the Cornish

1964
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,880
arms is in the center of Tav yes emmer

1965
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,840
and I Emma and I moved in there 12 years

1966
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,880
ago Liv there for 5 years and I suppose

1967
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,280
the biggest compliment I give us in the

1968
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,760
team is that we're cooking with our

1969
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,159
appetites we're cooking food we like to

1970
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:43,800
eat yeah that's the biggest thing I I I

1971
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,920
what have you just thrown in there so

1972
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,400
there's some some stock gone in there

1973
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,679
some um chicken and beef stock bit of

1974
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:50,560
gam sock and then some tomato Pata as

1975
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,120
well or chopped tomato to a certain

1976
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,480
extent I think that you know if you

1977
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,560
think of yourself as a kind of serious

1978
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,440
Chef you always have to cook the food

1979
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,880
that makes you happy because that's what

1980
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,000
makes it individual there's only one of

1981
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,040
you in life you know yeah and I suppose

1982
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,560
suppose it comes from that is I suppose

1983
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,719
we're lucky enough that we've we've

1984
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:09,719
driven that with two of you to be honest

1985
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,120
with

1986
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,280
you so then we're going to braze this

1987
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,880
for 40 minutes at 180 okay so you're

1988
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,719
doing that in the oven yeah I I I always

1989
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:18,880
even though I do it at home for the kids

1990
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,880
and stuff like we you make this at home

1991
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,960
for the kids well out of beef not out a

1992
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,080
game and then what you're left with is

1993
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,280
beautiful bnes Ragu again it' be

1994
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,639
beautiful with just some spaghetti or so

1995
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:31,800
you used pork fat to give it moisture

1996
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,199
pork Fat's going there as well yeah so

1997
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,239
that's what that's what that's our

1998
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:35,760
finished product so make sure when

1999
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,159
you're brazing it you braze it right

2000
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:38,360
down and reduce it CU we want it to be

2001
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,480
quite thick to put into the rav okay

2002
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,760
that's I think a lot of people are not

2003
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,880
in Hospitality don't realize how many

2004
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,040
good dishes comes out of oh I've got to

2005
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,920
use that up I have to find a nice way to

2006
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,520
to and all of a sudden something flowers

2007
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,320
and you've got a new B yeah and it's

2008
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,120
usually using the pits like we're saying

2009
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,880
the pork belly and that kind of when you

2010
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,840
got I always think bra beef cheeks and

2011
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,960
stuff like that you got bra beef stew I

2012
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,199
love when you got bra it properly I love

2013
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:07,639
stuff we're just going to kiss the edges

2014
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,600
of the pasta that you've kindly weighed

2015
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,480
out for me with a bit of the edges of

2016
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,000
the pasta yeah the sensual pasta we're

2017
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,239
not we're not we're not

2018
01:18:17,239 --> 01:18:19,600
dring nurturing it that's what we're

2019
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,880
doing he's trying to take your job I

2020
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,920
know it's been trying since he first

2021
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,520
came on all right you two are all

2022
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,000
professionals I know about that but and

2023
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,199
then we're going to build the

2024
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:31,960
ravioli

2025
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,520
so again it's key that we pinch that

2026
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,760
edge

2027
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,960
in get rid of all those air bubbles

2028
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,360
because if we don't get rid of that air

2029
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,360
it just explode when we when it hits so

2030
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,080
folks that don't know at home

2031
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,159
multiple of those is called ravioli yeah

2032
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:50,320
and singular is ravo

2033
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,639
raviolo and and then you get the other

2034
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:54,920
crazy chefs do open ravioli where it's

2035
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,199
not a

2036
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,520
ravioli life it's just a piece of

2037
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,000
bastard something there's one now would

2038
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,080
you make freeze them really well do you

2039
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,560
you can blanch them and freeze them yeah

2040
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,040
yeah they're not quite the same when you

2041
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,199
freeze them are they no you can't beat

2042
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:13,960
fresh pasta I don't think at least a bit

2043
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,320
of salt so they're cooking away nice

2044
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,840
well the Italians are pretty good at the

2045
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,760
frozen ravioli game the Frozen ra well I

2046
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,360
mean the the commercial Frozen Ian pasta

2047
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,480
can be very good so anyway that's

2048
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,840
cooking away nicely what what else are

2049
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,840
you doing now then going to go onto this

2050
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,400
um the garnish and the base we're going

2051
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,719
to let move that over there thank you

2052
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:35,600
James so what we've done here is sweated

2053
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,760
off some shalots just in some

2054
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,280
butter and some salt and then we just

2055
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,000
tied some time to um get that flavor of

2056
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,239
time going through the shalots and this

2057
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,520
is going to be our base that we're going

2058
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,280
to sit the raviol on and again like as a

2059
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,520
chef over the years we've always turned

2060
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,760
everything into purees and I just kind

2061
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,920
of want to come away from that a little

2062
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,040
bit and keep that real savory beautiful

2063
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,080
shot we've all got better teeth nowadays

2064
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,800
so this is almost like a classic SES

2065
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,159
would come out with some classic s

2066
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:05,239
through but we're going to De glass that

2067
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:07,480
with Sherry vinegar so you I mean we

2068
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,679
know that he trained classically in

2069
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,080
missing three missing St restaurants

2070
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,719
what about you for training I just I

2071
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:15,280
just found a really good my college

2072
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,840
lecture at College just in instilled

2073
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,120
into me classic French cookery guy

2074
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,920
called Colin nson and that's where he

2075
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,600
ignited a flaming me about cookery

2076
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,400
really where did you end up working when

2077
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,440
you were

2078
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,120
um went to a place a big fishing gaming

2079
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,639
shooting hotel called the irand alarms

2080
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,400
had three rosettes at a time there was

2081
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,360
20 chefs in the Brigade went in there's

2082
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,080
a Comm I thought it's do or die so

2083
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,560
either go and shine or jacket in and I

2084
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,920
don't know what I would have done really

2085
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,199
yeah but yeah and so it it came to Rish

2086
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:41,320
I was there for a couple of years and

2087
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,480
yeah and started off from there and

2088
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,960
again I've learned a lot of stuff about

2089
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,760
good produce when I was there so in

2090
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,760
these chots well put malt

2091
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,080
extracts so from malt barley and again

2092
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,239
it's going to give that real sweet note

2093
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:53,719
to it but it's not it's probably got

2094
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:55,320
half the sweetness of refined normal

2095
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,840
sugar right so it's going to give off

2096
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:59,760
that really rounded Savory note but this

2097
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,320
is the interesting thing with your food

2098
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,560
cuz you got you've got classic classic

2099
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,920
stuff as well as modern techniques you

2100
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,040
yeah yeah it's driven by the team and we

2101
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,239
are layering up flavors with punches of

2102
01:21:11,239 --> 01:21:14,320
acidity CU our food is very rich and we

2103
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,000
need that acidity to give you a little

2104
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,719
bit of Light Relief when you're also the

2105
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:21,639
texture gives you Tex texture gives you

2106
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:24,679
a relief from uh richness too I think

2107
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:26,480
yeah yeah you don't want it to be

2108
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,639
onedimensional no not all I'll tell you

2109
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,520
a story when I when I was working at the

2110
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,360
gabros I was telling my dad we had this

2111
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,199
dish on at Christmas time it was a

2112
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,120
mousse of grous served with a brussel

2113
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,920
throat puree a chestnut puree and a

2114
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,920
white onion puree I'm serve with a bit

2115
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,719
of je and my dad looks at me and says is

2116
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,840
that for it's that is that for the

2117
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,320
people who have no

2118
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,920
teeth I know we've all been guilty of it

2119
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,440
as Chef we've always gone and pureed

2120
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,159
everything and

2121
01:21:55,159 --> 01:21:58,120
trying in theory it's refined but I

2122
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,760
don't enjoy that type of food anymore no

2123
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,239
and I think as you get as you find your

2124
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,480
own style and your palette refines a bit

2125
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,320
then you kind of like you come away from

2126
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,840

I like when Chef's cooking but I don't

2180
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,880
like it when they put all the oil

2181
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,840
on but and again that I know you're

2182
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,239
banging on about flavor profiles and

2183
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,360
layering flavors that that olive oil

2184
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,719
gives a real nice pepperiness okay and a

2185
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:13,880
bit of mouth Pei too yeah and then what

2235
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,480
this Michin star chefs big gum on Chefs

2236
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,480
everything else we're going to do beef

2237
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,800
stew and

2238
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,520
dumplings wrong with that beef stew and

2239
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,119
beef stew and dumplings so I've got some

2240
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:42,600
beautiful beef over here we're going to

2241
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,320
use the Chuck but we got we're going to

2242
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,920
seal this off we dust it with a is Chuck

2243
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,719
your go-to then for a bit to me really

2244
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,800
but what is my go-to is I don't buy it

2245
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,480
from a supermarket because I get the

2246
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,080
meat from a Butch is I thought you going

2247
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,000
to say just wrestle with a

2248
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,119
wild have you seen her

2249
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:03,320
outside there's one L you know when you

2250
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,080
say Chuck I mean that sounds to me quite

2251
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,719
an American Chuck is that is that the

2252
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,920
same as brazing steak or what is it yes

2253
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,199
but when you yeah if you get brazing

2254
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,400
steak but you want a piece H and the

2255
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,960
pieces usually cost a little bit less

2256
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,199
than the portion it all up into dice so

2257
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,719
that's the only difference if I go in

2258
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,400
and say I want a Chuck a joint of Chuck

2259
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,000
joint of Chuck yeah and you'll get

2260
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,360
you'll go home and cut it like this with

2261
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,280
brazing steak there could be any amount

2262
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,600
of cuts that that they put in it and

2263
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,119
they'll all cook a different time yeah

2264
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:33,080
do the do the onions for me oh really

2265
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,880
yeah yeah yeah yeah it can be it can be

2266
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,480
anything like they'll cook at different

2267
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,159
times you won't get such a consistent

2268
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:40,360
result from different parts of the yeah

2269
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,800
they'll just all whack it into brazing

2270
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,199
steak you know that you do a lot of

2271
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:48,040
cooking so I do abely yeah this this

2272
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,920
what you want the key to this though to

2273
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,480
is is the Browning of it that's the most

2274
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,239
important bit so a little bit of flour

2275
01:27:53,239 --> 01:27:55,199
the flour doesn't necessarily help it

2276
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,119
brown but what the flour will do is

2277
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:00,480
thicken the stew so once you this is the

2278
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,440
bit that's going to thicken the stew we

2279
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,560
add no flour to it afterwards it's this

2280
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,719
in the right of stock and the amount of

2281
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:07,000
time that it takes to cook that's the

2282
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,040
key to it so I'm going to text you about

2283
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,639
your book first of all because you both

2284
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,159
sort of both of you we've got both we

2285
01:28:13,159 --> 01:28:15,320
match look at the color match we do

2286
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,600
match autobiography you say this is not

2287
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,639
an autobiography but it isn't it's kind

2288
01:28:19,639 --> 01:28:22,679
of stories the first half stories of my

2289
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:24,520
life second half it's kind of a Call to

2290
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,040
Arms Manifesto for women of a certain

2291
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,040
age would would you ever write an

2292
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,119
autobiography cuz I

2293
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:34,159
think tell the truth well I mean there

2294
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,199
there is a lot about me in the first

2295
01:28:36,199 --> 01:28:39,360
half yes there is a lot about me um she

2296
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,800
met Peter a all yeah I did told me a

2297
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,000
wonderful story about that's in the book

2298
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,920
that's exciting book yeah yeah but um

2299
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,920
yeah I mean to be honest I never

2300
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,920
imagined writing a book but the process

2301
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,960
of it I've absolutely loved and I I

2302
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,360
think I might I've got a couple of other

2303
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,119
things that I'm thinking about doing so

2304
01:29:00,119 --> 01:29:02,600
yeah but also I mean doing stuff like

2305
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,280
you you're both playing characters in

2306
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,760
theory you play characters but your you

2307
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,639
know people know you must the amount of

2308
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:09,840
people on the street that know you from

2309
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,520
the character not the real you because

2310
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,920
you've you've also been quite private in

2311
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,000
your so so writing a book for you must

2312
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,360
have been do I put that in do I do I not

2313
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,360
put it in yeah I mean that was hard for

2314
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,119
me because I you know in the book like I

2315
01:29:22,119 --> 01:29:24,480
said I've always kind of hidden from

2316
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,600
putting Sue out there people have only

2317
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,440
ever seen the character I play and I

2318
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,199
purposely I kept my life very private

2319
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:34,159
you know I wanted to bring up my son I

2320
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,360
didn't want the intrusion in his life

2321
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,520
and so yeah so it's been very it's very

2322
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,880
strange for me to just be out there and

2323
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,440
and and revealing all the jungle quite

2324
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,920
up you that's very revealing isn't it

2325
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,840
and I mean that was that that was a a

2326
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,440
great experience and we all I mean we

2327
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,440
did have a great I did have a really

2328
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,639
good time there there we all did and

2329
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,280
we're all still in touch which is really

2330
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,119
nice but the difficult I suppose for

2331
01:29:58,119 --> 01:29:59,679
that is the control you have no I mean

2332
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:00,920
you you don't have control when you go

2333
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,199
on this show but no let but you have you

2334
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,639
have no control over that do but at

2335
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:07,639
least you get fed there you know and you

2336
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:10,119
get you get well I last time I went is I

2337
01:30:10,119 --> 01:30:12,760
was eating food out of a sock that was

2338
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,320
and I didn't know what you had to guess

2339
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,199
what it is was point for the team point

2340
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:18,239
for the team yeah but I mean that is

2341
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,520
really putting yourself out of your

2342
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,920
comfort zone that's the only thing I

2343
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,760
think if everyone says what you realize

2344
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,840
is like how human beings do not like to

2345
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,080
be to be out of control not to be in

2346
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,400
control of things is not a nice feeling

2347
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,920
really well I guess I guess you get um

2348
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,119
um hungry and then you start not being

2349
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:37,400
yourself cuz you get a bit bad tempered

2350
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,880
when you're hungry what do you call it

2351
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,960
hungry hry hungry you do get you do get

2352
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,960
hungry I think that the boys were

2353
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,719
affected a bit more by that there were

2354
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:47,400
certain personalities that you could see

2355
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,800
were really struggle I was thought with

2356
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,560
the jungle when they do those challenges

2357
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,280
and you think oh I'm going to get going

2358
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,320
to get a fry up or whatever and then you

2359
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,840
get a plate of rice don't you for all

2360
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,400
those hard challenges yeah oh I mean the

2361
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,159
the the the worst one was where you can

2362
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,360
go out and get treats or something the

2363
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,080
to bring back and somebody came back and

2364
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:09,000
we literally had one jelly baby

2365
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,600
eat that's an absolute stitch up would

2366
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,159
you do it for the

2367
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:17,480
team you no no no I've I've been asked

2368
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:19,040
to do it and I like the idea of camping

2369
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,320
out with people I don't know and getting

2370
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,600
to know them but it's just the

2371
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,360
challenges when you've got to eat

2372
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,119
certain things a lot don't I think the

2373
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:26,760
strictly thing I did that that's Would

2374
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,840
You released 19 years ago 19 years

2375
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,960
strictly W was it really hard wow uh it

2376
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,080
was do you know what it it was a lot of

2377
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,920
training but it you expect that these

2378
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,400
people were multiple world champions you

2379
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,679
know that you and also you got to think

2380
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,679
do I do I want to look like

2381
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:45,679
a as if I've learned something after on

2382
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,239
a Saturday rather than just you you

2383
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,719
don't realize in your show like that how

2384
01:31:49,719 --> 01:31:51,520
big it is I suppose when you're in that

2385
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,119
big bubble cuz there's no real shows

2386
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:55,480
like that I suppose

2387
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,480
anymore mean it is amazing thing to do

2388
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,360
it's also hard because what the audience

2389
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,560
sees no no no would you oh I don't know

2390
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,600
I don't know what why wouldn't you do it

2391
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,440
then well it looks like really hard work

2392
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,679
I would I I would I would genuinely do

2393
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,960
it love to be to learn how to dance I I

2394
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,440

straight into theer I've seen him I've

2396
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,840
seen him dance if anybody needs to do it

2397
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,400
it's him I tell you what I would do I

2398
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,400
got just Joy it's Joy I got have to do

2399
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,320
the Christmas one and I think that's I

2400
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,199
guess a bit more Whimsical than the

2401
01:32:30,199 --> 01:32:31,920
actual one honestly I got have to do

2402
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,440
that last year and I was busy writing

2403
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,760
that book so I said I couldn't but maybe

2404
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,800
this year I would do it it's absolutely

2405
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,920
magical Chistmas one do the Christmas

2406
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,159

01:32:41,159 --> 01:32:44,600
do the we could partner each other yes

2408
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,840
right usually I can get a link this I've

2409
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,800
got no idea it's just a straight cut all

2410
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,080
right straight into the beo stew this we

2411
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,480
put the lid on it cook it for an hour

2412
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,679
and a half and then what we end up with

2413
01:32:54,679 --> 01:32:56,800
is one we've got in this pot over here

2414
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,280
the pot changes color at the same time

2415
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,760
cuz I have only got one of them and I've

2416
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,600

01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:56,760
of moisture you put in so put that in

2443
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,320

01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,119
is the one just for you lot you see just

2457
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:37,760

2458
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,840

2459
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,040
director calls this a money

2460
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:48,400
shot oh is as well yes Touch of that

2461
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,280
look at that crust on those

2462
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:54,320
duins it's naughty and then look at the

2463
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,040
crust on those

2464
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:00,040
dumpers it's not a thing you hear say

2465
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,400
every day but the thing about it is by

2466
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,920
having having the the meat that we

2467
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:07,560
talked about that you get look at that

2468
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,600
chunks of it yeah and I think that's

2469
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,960
that's what you want really otherwise it

2470
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,639
all sorts dissolves it you end up going

2471
01:35:13,639 --> 01:35:16,280
hunting tiny little bits of sort of

2472
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,480
nothing are it's all from the same

2473
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,080
muscle if you buy like that as well so

2474
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,000
it it'll bre you know what I am that's

2475
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,040
my takeaway from this I'm never going to

2476
